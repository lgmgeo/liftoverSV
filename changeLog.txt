July, 12, 2024, liftoverSV version 0.1.0_beta

	liftoverSV: Lifts over a Structural Variation VCF file from one reference build to another.

	Purpose:
	- Lift over #CHROM and POS

	- Lift over INFO/END and INFO/SVEND
	=> drop the SV if:
	Case1: one position (start or end) is lifted while the other doesn't
	Case2: one position (start or end) goes to a different chrom from the other
	Case3: "lifted start" > "lifted end"
	Case4: the distance between the two lifted positions changes significantly (difference between both SVLENs > 5%)

	- Lift over INFO/SVLEN, INFO/SVSIZE
